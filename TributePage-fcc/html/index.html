                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1920</strong> - The princess met Carol, Crown Prince of Romania, who quickly asked her hand

                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1921</strong> - Despite the bad reputation of the prince, Helen accepted and moved to
                    Romania,
                    where she soon gave birth to their only son, Prince Michael.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1925</strong> - Prince Carol abandoned his wife and renounced the throne in order to live

                <li>
                    <strong>1927</strong> - Helen was proclaimed "Queen Mother of Romania" as her son Michael

                <li>
                    <strong>1928</strong> - Distraught, Helen tried to persuade her husband to return to her but

                    agreement,
                    under which Helen was denied the right to return to Romania and the next day, finally
                    forced her into permanent exile in Italy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1940</strong> - Back in Romania, Helen found herself, however, subject to
                    the whim of the dictator, determined to keep the royal family in a purely ceremonial role.

                <li>
                    <strong>1942</strong> - Helen played a major role in stopping Antonescu from his

                    World War II, which led to her being awarded by the State of Israel with
                    the honorific of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Righteous_Among_the_Nations"
                        target="_blank">

                    făpturi
                    obișnuite. Dar dacă a trăit astfel, ea nu a încetat niciodată să gândească în felul unei
